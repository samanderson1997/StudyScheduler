# StudyScheduler
For my Software Validation module, I will be uploading my JavaScript Scheduler file as I add more features.

The scheduler takes an array of objects which contain information about subjects and how many target hours to schedule, and then plans them to a calendar on the main user interface. 

For the purpose of this module and for privacy reasons; I will be uploading the scheduler file only and not the full application.
